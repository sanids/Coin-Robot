## Coin-Robot

Using an MSP430 micro controller along with embedded C, programmed and developed the entire software 
framework of a robot that autonomously picked up metal coins using a manually constructed metal detector
and current detector. 
Implemented additional features such wireless remote control using Raspberry PI. Also implemented a camera to
recognize when a coin has been detected using computer vision **(OpenCV in Python)**.
